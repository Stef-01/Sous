## ACTIVE WORKSTREAM: 20-WEEK AUTONOMOUS MOAT-DEEPENING PLAN — IN PROGRESS

> Authored 2026-06-05. Full plan: **`docs/20-WEEK-AUTONOMOUS-MOAT-PLAN.md`**. The
> AUTO-BUILD track (rule 12) that runs while the founder-gated rails get
> credentials: 20 weeks, each deepening one compounding moat (Data/Content/
> Behavioral/Engine/Network), ordered by the STRATEGY §7 impact/effort matrix and
> the North Star (cooks/week). Phase 1 (W1–4) Engine×Data context intelligence →
> Phase 2 (W5–8) Content depth + voice → Phase 3 (W9–12) habit-loop depth →
> Phase 4 (W13–16) craft + reliability → Phase 5 (W17–20) Network-moat prep +
> founder-gated integration stubs. Founder gates (Auth, Storage, Realtime, Stripe,
> AI keys, beta cohorts, legal/clinical) are surfaced in the plan header with the
> autonomous prep that ships for each, so go-live is one config edit, not a rebuild.

---

## ACTIVE WORKSTREAM: STAGE 1+2 6-MONTH PLAN — IN PROGRESS

> Authored 2026-05-01. The full 26-week plan is in `docs/archive/STAGE-1-2-6MO-TIMELINE.md`. Headline: ship Parent Mode (research-backed, FDA-claim-safe) AND complete production hardening (Clerk, Neon, R2, Redis, Sentry, perf, a11y) by 2026-10-30. Stage 1 prototype is complete; Stage 3 Content tab is complete; this plan integrates remaining production-hardening work with the new Parent Mode feature workstream.
>
> Five phases: A (foundation, weeks 1–8), B (Parent Mode UX, weeks 9–12), C (production hardening, weeks 13–18), D (polish + content + closed beta + legal review, weeks 19–24), E (launch prep + buffer, weeks 25–26).
>
> See `docs/PARENT-MODE-RESEARCH.md` for the research that grounds the feature design and `docs/PARENT-MODE-PLAN.md` for the surface-by-surface design with prerequisites.

---

## STAGE 2 (PARTIAL): AUTONOMOUS PRODUCTION HARDENING — SHIPPED 2026-06

> The **AUTO-BUILD** slices of Stage 2 — everything achievable without an
> external account or human counsel (rule 12) — shipped this session. The
> founder-gated remainder is listed at the end so it isn't re-scoped as
> autonomous work.

### Shipped (autonomous, verified: typecheck + lint + ~3130 tests + build green)

- **SEO / structured data** — `src/lib/seo/recipe.ts` builds full Schema.org
  `Recipe` JSON-LD (ingredients, ordered `HowToStep`, ISO-8601 times, image,
  cuisine) injected via a server `cook/[slug]/layout.tsx`; per-dish
  `generateMetadata` (title/OG/Twitter/canonical) on cook + gift routes;
  `app/sitemap.ts` (131 URLs) + `app/robots.ts`. Verified live. 16 unit tests.
- **Security headers** — production CSP + `X-Frame-Options`, `nosniff`,
  `Referrer-Policy`, HSTS, `Permissions-Policy` in `next.config.ts` (prod-only
  so dev/preview is untouched). Verified on a local prod server.
- **PWA** — dependency-free, Turbopack-safe `public/sw.js` (network-first nav +
  offline fallback + stale-while-revalidate statics), branded
  `public/offline.html`, prod-only `ServiceWorkerRegister`. (Manifest already
  existed.)
- **Accessibility (WCAG AA pass over the whole app)** — focus-visible rings on
  unlabeled controls; tap-target fixes; placeholder colour-contrast (12 inputs
  → AA, computed ratios); `prefers-reduced-motion` gates on looping animations;
  semantic fixes (Games `<h1>`, input labels); and a complete overlay
  keyboard/focus contract — reusable `useBodyScrollLock` / `useDismissOnEscape`
  / `useFocusTrap` hooks applied to all 5 hand-rolled modals (focus-in,
  Tab-trap, Escape-restore — verified live), guarded by
  `use-overlay-a11y.test.ts`.
- **Path declutter** — hero-first hierarchy + grouped stats card, guarded by
  `path-hierarchy.test.ts`.

### Still founder-gated (needs credentials / a human — NOT autonomous)

- **Auth (Clerk)** — needs keys; provider + middleware already wired.
- **Real DB** — Supabase is already provisioned + seeded (see SUPABASE-SETUP);
  the Neon references below are superseded.
- **Image pipeline (Cloudflare R2)**, **Caching/rate-limit (Upstash Redis)**,
  **Error monitoring (Sentry)** — each needs an account + secret; the
  abstraction/env-var contract is the only autonomous prep and is in place.
- **Real Content-tab editorial** (clinician names + lab affiliations) — a
  Stage-2 editorial workstream protected by rule 11; sample content stays
  flagged `isPlaceholder`.
- **i18n** — DEFERRED to the final public launch (post-beta) per founder
  direction (2026-06-07). It is NOT a beta deliverable; do not schedule string
  externalization or number/unit localization into beta work.
- **Legal pages, clinical-partner flow** — content/decision work.

---

## STAGE 3: LEAN VIBE-CODED + CONTENT TAB — COMPLETE

> Pushed before Stage 2 (production hardening). Per Stefan's directive, grow user-facing surface as far as the lean prototype credibly can before paying the production-tax of Clerk + Neon + R2 + Sentry + Redis. Full spec in `docs/STAGE-3-LEAN-CONTENT.md`.

### Lean-vibe posture (zero new infra)

- All persistence remains `localStorage` + static JSON.
- All AI keeps its mock-provider fallback.
- Auth still bypassed with the mock user.
- Stage-2 concerns (Clerk, Neon, R2, Redis, Sentry, PWA, i18n, real video transcoding, content moderation, clinician verification) are explicitly deferred and called out in the Stage-3 doc.

### What shipped

- **Tab bar restructure** — third tab renamed `Content` (route id `community` preserved for compat), always-visible. Tab order is now Today · Path · Content.
- **Content home** (`/community`) — header, bookmark launcher, category filter strip (`For You · Reels · Articles · Research · Experts · Forum`), 3-card featured hero carousel, horizontal Reels rail, 2-column Articles grid, Research Spotlight stack, Expert Voices avatar row, Forum thread list, sample-content disclaimer.
- **Reel player sheet** — full-screen vertical sheet with simulated player chrome (poster image, progress bar, play overlay, like/save/share rail). Honest about the lack of real video. Like + view-count state persists locally via `useReelEngagement`.
- **Detail routes** — `/community/article/[slug]`, `/community/research/[slug]`, `/community/expert/[slug]`, `/community/forum/[id]`, `/community/reels`, `/community/saved`. Each has matching back nav, bookmark toggle, and disclaimer footer.
- **Forum reply box** — `useForumDrafts` writes mock-replies to localStorage; replies render in-thread with a "(local draft)" tag so the prototype is never confused with a server-backed forum.
- **Saved page** — bookmarked articles, reels, briefs, and threads in one surface, with empty state.
- **Sample content seed** — 6 articles, 8 reels, 6 research briefs, 4 expert profiles, 5 forum threads. Every item carries `isPlaceholder: true`. All authors are fictional. Affiliations carry the `(sample)` suffix. No new images invented — only `/public/food_images/*.png` already in repo.
- **New hooks** — `useContentBookmarks` (kind:id keyed, 100-cap), `useContentFilter` (sessionStorage), `useReelEngagement`, `useForumDrafts`.
- **CLAUDE.md updated** — rule 5 superseded note, rule 11 extended with Content tab + sample-content guardrails.

### What did not move

- Production hardening — Stage 2 still untouched.
- Recipe data, pairing engine, Today/Path surfaces — unchanged.
- AI router and mock fallback — unchanged.

## STAGE 0.9: NEXT-20D HABIT + TRUST + POLISH — COMPLETE

A fourth 20-phase sprint focused on turning the app into a habit: surfacing
the user's own cooking rhythm, strengthening the social loop, tightening
craving search, and sharpening guided-cook trust with zero new UI clutter.
All phases shipped 2026-04-17. See `docs/NEXT-20D-PHASES.md` for the full
plan.

- **P1** — `deriveCookRhythm` + ambient "Tuesday nights: you usually cook" line on Today, silent until the user has at least 4 completed cooks across 2+ distinct weeks.
- **P2** — Ingredient-reuse hint on `QuestCard`: `matchIngredientReuse` finds one shared named ingredient between today's top pick and a cook from the last 7 days, rendered as a single warm line ("reuses cilantro from Friday's tacos").
- **P3** — "You made this before" recall chip on Mission screen when the user is re-cooking a past dish, using `useCookSessions` last-completed timestamp.
- **P4** — Streak-aware welcome line on Today: copy adapts to 0 / 1–2 / 3+ day streak, stays quiet and returnable.
- **P5** — Post-cook invite sheet: single `sms:` deep-link on the Win screen (one-time prompt per unique cook), wired through `useInvitePrompts`.
- **P6** — `FriendsStrip` "new since last visit" dot: `useFriendsLastSeen` stamps a mount-time snapshot and only flags friend tiles whose approximate post time is newer than the last visit.
- **P7** — Gift page CTA polish: stars moved up to the header row beside the sender, primary CTA re-worded to "Cook this too."
- **P8** — `CameraInput` 6-second fallback: if recognition hangs, a "Didn't work — try typing instead" button surfaces and closes the camera.
- **P9** — `TextPrompt` empty-state starter chips swap from single words to evocative compound queries ("Chicken pasta", "Quick rice bowl").
- **P10** — Local result cap (6) with "Show N more" expanders on both literal and semantic match lists to keep the results sheet scannable.
- **P11** — Pre-cook `CookWatchlist`: collapsed chip at the top of the Grab phase listing all unsuppressed mistake warnings for the dish, per-dish scoped via `useMistakeSuppression`.
- **P12** — Step re-read via tap: double-tap the current instruction in `StepCard` to re-trigger text-to-speech without leaving the step.
- **P13** — Substitution memory: new `useSubstitutionMemory` hook (90-day per-dish/per-ingredient TTL) + "Saved as my swap" button in the AI substitute panel and "last time: X" hint in `IngredientList`.
- **P14** — Win-screen low-star feedback: 1- or 2-star ratings reveal 3 deterministic chips ("too salty", "too dry", "instructions unclear") that write back onto the cook session record.
- **P15** — Landing lazy-load: `AppPreviewSection`, `ScreenshotCarousel`, and `TrustStrip` moved behind `next/dynamic` (ssr: false) to shrink the LCP-blocking bundle on `/`.
- **P16** — A11y sweep on sprint surfaces (`FilterDropdown`, `MistakeChip` dismiss, `IngredientList` station toggle, `CookWatchlist`): visible focus rings + bare-icon-button `aria-label`s.
- **P17** — Reduced-motion sweep: `useReducedMotion` gates WinScreen confetti and simplifies `PreferenceStrip` expand/chevron animation for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **P18** — New-hook unit tests: `use-substitution-memory.test.ts` (6) + `use-mistake-suppression.test.ts` (6) cover versioned storage keys, TTL expiry, malformed-entry rejection, and key format stability.
- **P19–P20** — Lint, 222 vitest tests green (26 files), production build clean, changes committed to main.

---

## STAGE 0.8: NEXT-20C MEMORY + RELATIONSHIPS + PERFORMANCE — COMPLETE

A third 20-phase sprint focused on making the app remember the user, surface
preference-aware moments, and coalesce multi-dish prep without adding UI
clutter. All phases shipped 2026-04-17. See `docs/archive/NEXT-20C-PHASES.md` for the
full plan.

- **P1** — `PreferenceStrip` on Path renders a single collapsed "What Sous has learned" line backed by `derivePreferenceObservations` over the user's completed cook sessions; auto-suppresses after three views and only appears once real data exists.
- **P2** — `buildPairingRationale` + new "Because you cooked X" ambient line on `QuestCard` ties today's suggestion to a recent cook via shared taxonomy axes (cuisine / protein / technique / flavor), with 3 new unit tests.
- **P3** — `RepeatCookChip` upgraded to distinguish "recent" (≤14 days) and "revive" (21–90 days) loved dishes and drop a gentle, non-guilting nudge; 8 new unit tests over `pickRepeatCandidate`.
- **P4** — Preference-decay halo on skill-tree nodes: `preference-decay.ts` (`computeFreshness`) decays 10% per 30 days with a 0.15 floor; `SkillNode` paints a warm radial halo whose opacity tracks freshness; `useSkillProgress` now stamps `lastCookedAt` on every recorded cook.
- **P7** — `FriendsStrip` tiles become tap-through routes to the read-only `/gift/<slug>` gift page, turning the social strip into a zero-friction inspiration surface.
- **P8** — `useShareLog` + imperative `logShare` persist share events in `localStorage`; `WinScreen` logs every successful gift; new `CooksSharedLine` on Path renders a single-line tally ("3 meals shared — Alex cooked one of them.") silent until the user has shared at least once.
- **P10** — `useCravingHistory` remembers the user's last 5 craving queries for 30 days (MRU, case-insensitive dedup); `TextPrompt` now shows a one-tap "Recent" chip row on focus when the input is empty.
- **P11** — Live filter application in craving results: `TextPrompt` consumes `useQuestFilters` so cook-time and cuisine filters active on `QuestCard` also filter the local search results, with a clearable "Filters on: ≤30 min · Indian" pill at the top of the results.
- **P12** — Why-this-match tap-to-expand on semantic matches: `find-closest-dishes` now returns a `matched` axes breakdown, `TextPrompt` renders an inline "Why?" expander listing the exact axes that hit (name / form / cuisine / protein / sauce / flavor / technique).
- **P13** — Pre-cook prep-list coalescing: new `coalescePrepList` utility (5 unit tests) merges ingredients across all dishes in a combined cook, groups them by inferred station (cutting-board / stove / oven / blender / other), and `IngredientList` gains a "By dish / By station" toggle that keeps existing checked state intact via `prepSourceIds`.
- **P15** — Mistake-chip dismissible with memory: new `useMistakeSuppression` hook (180-day per-dish suppression map) + `X` dismiss button on `MistakeChip`; `StepCard` threads `dishSlug` + `stepNumber` so suppressions are scoped, not global.
- **P19–P20** — Lint, 194 vitest tests green (21 files), production build clean, changes committed to main.

---

## STAGE 0.7: PATH MODAL OVERLAP RCA + REMEDIATION — COMPLETE

A targeted hotfix sprint triggered by a screenshot showing the Sprint 20B
P16 hover-tooltip fix had not actually resolved the overlap. Full RCA in
`docs/archive/PATH-OVERLAP-RCA.md`. Shipped 2026-04-17.

- **Phase 0** — Written RCA mapping every observed symptom (header clip, floating tooltip, label overlap, FAB overlap, default scrollbar, whitespace) to root cause before touching code.
- **Phase 1** — `TrainingHoverPanel` component deleted outright; removed from `SkillNodeComponent` + `MasteryCuisineCard`; `.skill-hover-preview` block removed from `globals.css`. Native `title` attribute retained on every node for hover information without any overlay.
- **Phase 2** — `.app-header` carries `padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px)` so notch/status-bar regions never clip header content on iOS standalone PWA or phone-frame emulators.
- **Phase 3** — `html { scrollbar-gutter: stable }` plus a soft `rgba(15,23,42,0.10)` webkit/firefox scrollbar so the 15-17 px layout shift and competing-with-chrome visuals are gone.
- **Phase 4** — Badges entry point moved OUT of a floating FAB and INTO the `PathHeader` as an inline chip next to Streak + Trophy. `AchievementsLauncher` is now headless by default and exposes an imperative `open()` handle via `useImperativeHandle` / `openRef`. Eliminates the entire class of FAB-over-content overlaps.
- **Phase 5** — Live-browser visual verification at 390×844 via the Cursor IDE browser MCP. Scrolled every tier of the skill tree and confirmed no overlays, no clipping, no visible default scrollbar.
- **Phase 6** — Lint, 180 vitest tests, production build all green.
- **Phase 7** — This commit + ROADMAP update.

---

## STAGE 0.6: NEXT-20B DECLUTTER + SEMANTIC CRAVING + LANDING POLISH — COMPLETE

A second 20-phase sprint focused on simplifying the Today home, upgrading craving search with rule-based semantic matching, enriching the marketing landing with phone-frame mockups and a screenshot carousel, and rectifying visual bugs on the Path screen. All phases shipped 2026-04-16. See `docs/NEXT-20B-PHASES.md` for the full plan.

- **P1–P2** — `MoreOptionsSheet` bottom drawer consolidates TonightChip (commit pill) + CookForTwoChip + quick-helper actions; Today page no longer carries "Make something in 15 minutes" or FallbackActions in the primary view.
- **P3–P4** — `FriendsStrip` upgraded from a plain list into a social-feed-style row with meal photos, friend avatars, and time-ago labels; seeded by mock `friend-cooks.ts` data layered with the user's own completed cooks.
- **P5–P8** — Reusable `FilterDropdown` primitive replaces the single "Under 20 min" toggle with two minimalist pill-dropdowns (cook time + cuisine) on `QuestCard`. `useQuestFilters` hook persists state in `sessionStorage`.
- **P9–P12** — Rule-based semantic craving matcher (`dish-taxonomy.ts` + `find-closest-dishes.ts`) scores dishes across protein / sauce / technique / flavor / form / cuisine / dairy axes. Wired into `TextPrompt` under a "Closest to what you're craving" section with one-line reasons. 8 unit tests.
- **P13–P15** — Landing: new `AppPreviewSection` (three phone frames rendering real Today/Path/Win mockups using live app components), `ScreenshotCarousel` (horizontal bleed of real food photos with dish-captions), `TrustStrip` (dotted editorial row — "no logins", "no ads", "on-device", "under 10s").
- **P16** — Training hover tooltip on Path skill nodes gated to `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` so it never triggers on touch devices; new `.skill-hover-preview` class in `globals.css` replaces the Tailwind stack that allowed overlap.
- **P17** — `PathHeader` tightened: single-caption XP bar, 36px level badge, compact title + streak + skills trophy row; removed redundant "X/Y XP to level N+1" sub-caption and stray `ChevronRight`.
- **P18** — Badges FAB: 44×44 minimum tap target, larger shadow, stronger focus ring, safe-area-aware bottom offset (`calc(5.25rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`), z-index raised above tab bar but below modals.
- **P19–P20** — Lint, 180 vitest tests green, production build clean, changes committed to main.

---

## STAGE 0.5: NEXT-20 INTUITION + BEAUTY BUILD — COMPLETE

A focused 20-phase pass on making the app more intuitive, accessible, and visually engaging, with a middle-aged-to-senior user in mind. All phases shipped between 2026-04-15 and 2026-04-16. See `docs/archive/NEXT-20-PHASES.md` for the full plan.

- **Phase 1** — Readable-by-default typography pass (css variables for body/caption/cook sizes, cook-prose class).
- **Phase 2** — Tap target + contrast audit via a shared `IconButton` primitive (all icon controls ≥44×44).
- **Phase 3** — Plain-language cook step glossary (`cook-glossary.ts`, `Glossify` component, inline tooltips).
- **Phase 4** — Path ambient hero with time-of-day gradient and warm headline copy.
- **Phase 5** — Living skill tree with stroke-draw connectors and bloom animations on mastery.
- **Phase 6** — Cuisine constellation SVG on Path (quiet celebration of culinary reach).
- **Phase 7** — Journey montage strip (horizontal scroll of recent cook polaroids).
- **Phase 8** — "Tonight" commitment chip on Today (localStorage, auto-expiring).
- **Phase 9** — "Plan my cook" chip on Mission (eat-by time → start-cooking-at time).
- **Phase 10** — Pantry-aware ranking in QuestCard (`computePantryFit`, "already have most of this" chip).
- **Phase 11** — Quick-win "Under 20 min" filter + "Welcome back" path hero for returning users.
- **Phase 12** — Read-aloud step player with graceful fallback when speech synthesis is unavailable.
- **Phase 13** — Big-hands mode (session-scoped, `data-big-hands` CSS variables, edge-tap auto-nudge).
- **Phase 14** — Timer stack timeline on `/cook/combined` (multi-timer `useCookStore`, `TimerStack` pills).
- **Phase 15** — Repeat-cook shortcut on Today (shows last ≥4-star cook within 14 days).
- **Phase 16** — Rest-day grace (1-per-week cap, preserves streak, dotted-outline visual state).
- **Phase 17** — Kitchen confidence dial on Path (derived gauge, 4 tiers, no number).
- **Phase 18** — Recipe gift link (`/gift/<slug>?from=<name>&stars=<n>` read-only preview, no signup wall).
- **Phase 19** — Household taste blend ("Cook for two" chip + single slider, blends preference vector).
- **Phase 20** — Final audit + polish (full lint + 172 tests + prod build green; Playwright smokes for read-aloud, Tonight round-trip, and rest-day streak invariant).

Remaining deferred items (require live environment): Lighthouse runs for `/today`, `/path`, `/cook/[slug]`; manual 375×667 viewport pass; visual regression screenshot baseline in `docs/screenshots/2026-04-phase-20/`.

## STAGE 1: PROTOTYPE BUILD

The goal is a working, demoable prototype. No auth enforcement, no production infra, no payment. Everything persists in localStorage. The full core loop — craving → pairing → evaluate → guided cook → win → scrapbook → path — must work end-to-end.

---

### What's Already Built

These features exist as real, substantial code — not stubs.

#### Core Experience (Today Tab)

- **Today page** (`src/app/(today)/page.tsx`) — full state machine: idle → loading → results | camera → recognition → correction. Working.
- **Quest card stack** (`src/components/today/quest-card.tsx`) — swipeable Tinder-style cards, drag overlays, heart/X buttons. Pool draws from all 76 meals + 119 guided-cook sides with smart scoring, daily rotation, and preference matching. Working.

### Explicitly Deferred from Prototype

These are intentionally out of scope for Stage 1:

| Feature                                    | Status                                                                                |

## STAGE 2: PRODUCTION LAUNCH

These are the concerns that must be resolved before Sous goes live for real users. None of these are needed for a demo or prototype.

---

### Auth (Clerk)

- Enable Clerk auth fully — `src/components/auth-provider.tsx` and `src/middleware.ts` exist but auth is not enforced on any route.
- Add login/signup flow with social providers (Google, Apple).
- Associate cook sessions with Clerk user IDs (currently local sessions use `local-${Date.now()}`).
- `cook.start` / `cook.complete` already write to DB when `ctx.userId` is present — just need auth enforced.
- Migrate localStorage sessions to DB on first login ("import your history" flow).

### Real Database (Neon Postgres + Drizzle)

- Provision a Neon Postgres database and set `DATABASE_URL`.
- Run `pnpm db:push` to apply the 7-table Drizzle schema.
- Run `pnpm db:seed` to seed the side dish and meal catalog.
- Fill in the 6 stubbed tRPC endpoints: `journey.recent`, `journey.stats`, `coach.quiz`, `coach.vibePrompt`, `content.getSideDish`, `content.search`.
- Replace localStorage-only session hooks with server-backed equivalents (localStorage can remain as optimistic cache).

### Performance

- Lazy-load the pairing engine and data files (currently bundled at build time).
- Add ISR or edge caching for the `pairing.suggest` endpoint.
- Optimize Framer Motion bundle — tree-shake unused features.
- Image optimization — switch from Unsplash URLs to Next.js `<Image>` with blur placeholders.
- Audit and reduce initial JS bundle to under 150KB gzipped (current target from `planning.md`).
- Lighthouse score ≥ 90 on mobile.

### Caching and Rate Limiting (Upstash Redis)

- Add Upstash Redis for rate limiting on AI endpoints (`recognition.identify`, `pairing.suggest`).
- Cache pairing results per main dish slug to reduce AI API costs on repeat queries.
- Cache food recognition results by image hash to avoid re-querying Vision API for the same photo.

### Image Pipeline (Cloudflare R2)

- Stand up a Cloudflare R2 bucket for food images.
- Replace Unsplash URLs with R2-hosted, culturally reviewed photography.
- Build an image upload pipeline for Win screen photos (currently `photoUri` in cook sessions is a local blob URL that doesn't persist across devices).

### Error Monitoring (Sentry)

- Add Sentry for both client and server-side error capture.
- Set up alert rules for: AI API failures, pairing engine errors, database query failures.
- Add source maps for production stack traces.

### Analytics

- Expand Vercel Analytics stub (`src/lib/analytics.ts`) with real event tracking: search submitted, pairing viewed, cook started, cook completed, evaluate opened, plate shared.
- Set up a funnel view: search → results → cook → win.
- Track feature discovery rates (how many users find Evaluate, Path, scrapbook).

### SEO

- Add `og:image` and `twitter:card` meta tags to the Today page (shareable plate preview image).
- Add structured data (Schema.org Recipe) for guided cook pages.
- Generate a sitemap for `/cook/[slug]` routes.
- Ensure all pages have unique, descriptive `<title>` and `<meta description>` tags.

### Security

- Enforce Clerk auth on all mutation tRPC endpoints in production (`publicProcedure` → `protectedProcedure` where appropriate).
- Add input sanitization and output validation on all AI endpoints (Zod schemas are defined — enforce them at the route boundary).
- Rate limit camera/recognition endpoint per user to prevent Vision API abuse.
- Review and restrict CORS policy on the tRPC API route.
- Add Content-Security-Policy headers.
- Rotate any API keys currently in `.env.local` and store in Vercel Environment Variables.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Set up GitHub Actions: lint + test on every PR.
- Block merges to `main` if `pnpm lint` or `pnpm test` fail.
- Add Playwright E2E smoke tests to CI (requires running Vercel preview URL).
- Add automated Lighthouse CI check on PRs touching Today page or Guided Cook.
- Configure preview deployments on Vercel for all PRs.

### Accessibility

- Full WCAG 2.1 AA audit on core flows (search, results, guided cook, evaluate).
- Keyboard navigation for the quest card stack and search popout.
- Screen reader labels on all icon-only buttons.
- Verify `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected everywhere (hook exists in `src/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts`).
- Color contrast audit — the cream/stone palette needs verification at small text sizes.

### Additional Production Concerns

- **PWA / installability** — Add a web app manifest, service worker, and offline fallback for the core Today page.
- **Multi-language** — Spanish, Hindi, Tagalog are the highest-priority candidates per the PRD (Stanford patient demographics).
- **Legal disclaimers** — "Not medical advice" notice, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service pages.
- **Data retention policy** — Define and implement a policy for cook session data (user deletion, data export).
- **Clinical partner flow** (from PRD) — Clinician referral links, curated starter packs per cuisine, anonymous patient exploration tracking (opt-in).
