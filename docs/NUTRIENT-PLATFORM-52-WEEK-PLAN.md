# Sous Nutrient & Ingredient Platform — Deep Appraisal + 52-Week Plan

_Authored 2026-06-06. Grounds: the live Sous nutrition infra map, two external
research passes (open-source repos + canonical data sources), and the macro-ring
UI already shipped (`e1aa9c1`). Follows rule 12 (AUTO-BUILD vs FOUNDER-GATED)
and rule 13 (minimal text, disclosure on demand)._

---

## ✅ SHIPPED STATUS (updated 2026-06-07)

~30 of the 52 weeks are built, each implemented → adversarially reviewed → fixed
→ committed, all green (3278 tests). The recursive-review loop caught and fixed a
**critical false-safety allergen bug** (173/219 dishes falsely "gluten-free"), 7
regressions, a science overstatement, an over-precise %DV claim, and a misleading
protein nudge — none of which single-pass work would have caught.

**Remaining — a genuinely different character (deliberately not force-fit):**

- **Delicate / diminishing-returns:** quantity-normalizer handling ("1 can", "to
  taste", garnishes) for the last slice of coverage — modeling assumptions the
  honesty reviews would (rightly) scrutinise.
- **Big data lift:** W20–W21 branded-food engine (Open Food Facts ODbL import) —
  lower Sous-Test fit (logging packaged foods isn't cooking).
- **FOUNDER-GATED:** W22 barcode scanner · W42 clinician content review · W43
  personalized EER (needs NASEM coefficients) · W9–W10 personalized DRI (needs a
  profile + the pediatric DRI table extended past its public-health subset).
- **Polish:** W36–W39, W48–W52 (a11y, perf, i18n, regression, docs).

The high-Sous-value AUTO-BUILD nutrition work is functionally complete: cook →
log → the engine learns your gaps → it suggests sides that close them, with
honest, safety-reviewed data throughout.

## Part 1 — Deep critical appraisal: does this work frictionlessly + at scale?

### 1.1 What the user actually asked for

Three intertwined product moves:

1. **A real nutrient platform** — not just cal+macros, but the full Cronometer-style
   picture: a macro ring, macronutrient targets, key micronutrients, and an
   expandable complete summary (vitamins, minerals, amino acids).
2. **An "Info" surface** (renamed from "Health") that fuses **health context +
   nutrition + an ingredients-to-check list**, so a user can decide _before
   committing to cook_ — "do I even have these ingredients?"
3. **The same Info, tappable, on side pairings** — so the decision ("do I want to
   make this?") happens at the pairing step too.

### 1.2 The core insight — Sous is ~70% there already

The expensive part of a nutrient platform is the **ingredient→nutrient engine**,
and Sous already has a real one:

- `src/lib/nutrition/compose.ts` — deterministic per-serving composition
  (Σ ingredient per-100g × grams ÷ servings), oil-absorption (10% for deep-fry),
  Result-pattern error handling.
- `src/data/ingredients/registry.generated.ts` — **112 USDA-mapped ingredients**,
  18-nutrient per-100g vectors, `fdcId` provenance.
- `src/lib/nutrition/quantity-to-grams.ts` — unit parsing (mass/volume/count,
  unicode fractions, density, "to taste" → null).
- `src/data/ingredients/recipe-links.generated.ts` — **144 recipes resolved**
  (~70% coverage), gated for display at `massedCoverage ≥ 0.7`.
- Targets exist: `fda-dv.ts` (FDA Daily Values, 21 CFR 101.9) + `dri-pediatric.ts`
  (NASEM DRIs, age-banded).

**So the platform is not a greenfield build — it's three expansions of a working
engine:** (a) widen the nutrient vector 18 → 40+ (incl. amino acids), (b) widen
the registry 112 → ~500 ingredients, (c) new _surfaces_ (Info, side-pairing
detail, daily diary). The macro-ring UI is already done.

### 1.3 Will it be frictionless? — the mechanics, flow by flow

**Frictionless principle #1 — precompute at build time, never at runtime.**
The engine is deterministic. Every dish's nutrient vector is composed _once_ by a
generator script (`scripts/nutrition/resolve-dishes.mjs`, already exists) and
committed as static JSON (`recipe-links.generated.ts`). The app never calls a
nutrition API at runtime → zero latency, works offline, no API keys, no rate
limits. **This is the single most important scalability decision and it's already
the architecture.** Widening to 500 ingredients changes the generated file size,
not the runtime cost.

**Frictionless principle #2 — the "ingredients-to-check" list is free.**
We already resolve a dish's ingredient lines (name + quantity) for the cook flow
(`IngredientList`) and the grocery thread. The Info sheet's "do I have these?"
list is the _same data_ cross-referenced against `usePantry()` (which already
exists). No new data — just a new view: each ingredient row shows a have/need
state (pantry hit = check, miss = empty), so the user sees coverage at a glance
_before_ committing. This is the highest-friction-reducing feature and it's
nearly free.

**Frictionless principle #3 — disclosure on demand (rule 13).**
The Info sheet shows, in order: a one-line health takeaway → the macro ring →
ingredients-to-check. Micros and the complete nutrient summary stay behind the
ring's expander. Side-pairing cards show nothing extra inline; a tap opens the
same Info sheet. No screen is text-heavy by default.

**The decision flow becomes:**

```
Today quest / side pairing
  → tap "Info"
    → health takeaway (1 line)   "Good source of fiber + omega-3"
    → macro ring + targets       (the shipped component)
    → ingredients to check       ✓ have 6 · need 2   ← decide here
  → "Cook this"  (only after the user knows they can)
```

The friction that exists today — committing to a cook, hitting the Grab screen,
_then_ discovering you're missing fish sauce — is removed.

### 1.4 Will it scale? — four scale axes, honestly assessed

| Axis               | Today                                                       | At 500 ingredients / 1000 dishes                                          | Bottleneck?                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Runtime perf**   | static JSON, O(1) lookup                                    | identical (precomputed)                                                   | **No** — this is the whole point of build-time composition                                 |
| **Bundle size**    | registry ~deferred from Today (`guided-cook-summary` split) | 40 nutrients × 500 ingr ≈ ~1–2 MB JSON; keep it server-only / route-split | **Watch** — never ship the full registry to the Today bundle; lazy-load per dish           |
| **Coverage**       | 112 ingr → ~70% dishes                                      | 500 ingr → ~95% dishes                                                    | **The real work** — coverage is a data-curation grind, not an eng problem                  |
| **Data freshness** | SR Legacy frozen 2018                                       | same (whole-food composition is stable)                                   | **No** — whole-food nutrients don't change; branded foods (OFF) are the only moving target |

**The honest bottleneck is coverage, not engineering.** Going 112→500 ingredients
is a build-time import from USDA FDC (CC0) + name-matching curation. The
architecture already handles it; the work is matching ingredient names to FDC IDs
and verifying. That's why the plan front-loads a **bulk USDA import + matching
pipeline** (Q1) — it converts a manual grind into a generated artifact.

### 1.5 The moat angle (rule 8 / STRATEGY.md)

This deepens the **Data × Engine** moat already established by W1 (pantry
reranker). A recipe app that knows _the full nutrient consequence of every
ingredient choice_ — and can swap a side to fix a deficiency — is defensible in a
way a recipe list is not. The ingredient registry is the compounding asset: every
ingredient added improves coverage across all dishes that use it.

### 1.6 Risks + mitigations

| Risk                                     | Mitigation                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| USDA SR Legacy frozen at 2018            | Whole-food composition is stable; acceptable. Foundation Foods (updated 2026) overrides where present.                                  |
| Branded items (OFF) are ODbL share-alike | Isolate OFF-derived data in its own namespace + attribution; never republish the derived dump. Keep core CC0.                           |
| 2023 EER coefficients only in a PDF      | Personalized energy target is FOUNDER-GATED on transcribing Table 5-16; ship FDA DV reference targets first (already done in the ring). |
| Amino-acid / micro accuracy              | Provenance + confidence flags already exist (`provenance`, `confidence`); surface them; gate display at coverage ≥ 0.7.                 |
| Medical-claim liability                  | Reuse the existing food-first hedge + clinician-review status; never prescribe.                                                         |

(stale), `ifct2017` (India-specific + AGPL ambiguity). Facts (DRI/EAA numbers)
aren't copyrightable — transcribe rather than depend.

**Net:** the core stack is CC0/MIT; the only copyleft (OFF/ODbL) is quarantined
to the branded tier and only matters if we _republish_ the dataset (we won't).

## Part 3 — The 52-week plan

Legend: **[AB]** = AUTO-BUILD (everything needed is in-repo + npm + CC0 data;
an autonomous agent can ship it). **[FG]** = FOUNDER-GATED (needs an account,
paid service, real human/clinician, or real users) — each lists the shippable
AUTO-BUILD prep so integration is one config edit away when unblocked.

### Founder-gated dependencies (surfaced up front, act in parallel)

- **G1 — Personalized targets**: the 2023 NASEM EER Table 5-16 coefficients live
  only in the report PDF. _Prep (AB):_ build the `eer.json` schema + the target
  engine against FDA DV; flip to personalized when the founder transcribes ~30
  coefficients.
- **G2 — Barcode scanner**: a camera-barcode flow needs a device + a scanning lib
  decision + (optionally) the OFF live API. _Prep (AB):_ the branded-lookup
  engine + a manual "search branded food" path; the scanner is a thin front-end.
- **G3 — Clinician sign-off** on any new health takeaways (rule 11). _Prep (AB):_
  everything ships `isEducational: true` / "Educational" badge until reviewed.
- **G4 — Real DRI clinical review** for the personalized recommendation copy.

### Q1 (W1–13) — Foundation: widen the engine, ship the Info surface

**W1 — USDA FDC bulk import pipeline [AB]**

- Goal: a reproducible script that ingests the FDC SR Legacy + Foundation JSON and
  emits a queryable local food table.
- Files: `scripts/nutrition/import-fdc.mjs` (download/cache the CC0 zips to a
  git-ignored `.cache/fdc/`, parse `food.csv`/`food_nutrient.csv`/`nutrient.csv`/
  `food_portion.csv`), `src/data/nutrition/fdc-foods.generated.json` (slim: only
  whole-food candidates we'll map).
- Verify: script prints food count + nutrient coverage; a unit test asserts a
  known food (e.g. "Avocado, raw") resolves with protein/fat/fiber/folate.
- Detail: keep only Foundation + SR Legacy data types; drop Branded here.

**W2 — Widen the nutrient vector 18 → ~40 [AB]**

- Goal: extend `NutrientVector` / `PerServingNutrition` to the full panel: all B
  vitamins (B1/B2/B3/B5/B6/folate/B12), C, D, E, K, choline; minerals (Ca, Fe, Mg,
  P, K, Na, Zn, Cu, Mn, Se); water; cholesterol; sat/mono/poly fat; sugars; the 9
  EAAs as an optional sub-object.
- Files: `src/types/nutrition.ts` (add fields, all optional for back-compat),
  `src/lib/nutrition/compose.ts` (sum the new fields — it's vector addition, the
  loop already generalizes), the FDC nutrient-id → our-key map in
  `scripts/nutrition/fdc-nutrient-map.ts`.
- Verify: `pnpm typecheck`; compose test sums a 2-ingredient recipe across all
  fields; the drift-guard tests still pass.

**W3 — Regenerate the registry from FDC (112 → ~250) [AB]**

- Goal: every existing ingredient gets the full 40-nutrient vector from its
  `fdcId`; add ~140 new high-frequency ingredients (matched by name).
- Files: `scripts/ingredients/build-registry.mjs` (join our ingredient list to
  `fdc-foods.generated.json` by fdcId, fall back to fuzzy name match flagged
  `confidence: "approximated"`), regenerate `registry.generated.ts`.
- Verify: coverage report (resolved %), a test that every `fdcId`-mapped
  ingredient has ≥ 30 non-null nutrients.

**W4 — Regenerate recipe links + nutrition (coverage jump) [AB]**

- Re-run `scripts/nutrition/resolve-dishes.mjs` + `gen-cook-summary.ts` so all
  dishes pick up the widened vectors; re-run drift guards. Expected coverage
  70% → ~85%.

**W5 — Macro-ring polish + the full nutrient grouping [AB]**

- Goal: the shipped `NutritionRingCard` already renders ring + targets + key
  micros + expandable. Extend the expandable to the FDC grouping taxonomy:
  **General · Vitamins · Minerals · Amino acids · Fats** (matching the reference's
  "Complete Nutrient Summary" sections).
- Files: `nutrition-ring-card.tsx` (group `buildMicros` output by category;
  amino-acid rows when present), `src/lib/nutrition/nutrient-taxonomy.ts`.
- Verify: live — a high-protein dish (e.g. grilled salmon) shows an Amino acids
  group with isoleucine/leucine/lysine like the reference.

**W6 — "Info" surface: rename + restructure [AB]**

- Goal: rename the Today meal-card "Health" sheet → **"Info"**; structure it as
  **health takeaway (1 line) → NutritionRingCard → ingredients-to-check**.
- Files: `src/components/today/meal-health-sheet.tsx` (label + aria "Health"→
  "Info"; icon HeartPulse→Info), `meal-health-panel.tsx` (compose the three
  sections; drop the old 4-col macro grid in favor of the ring).
- Verify: live — the Today meal card "Info" grabber opens the new sheet.

**W7 — Ingredients-to-check component [AB]**

- Goal: a reusable list showing each dish ingredient with a have/need state vs the
  pantry, + a "need 2" summary, + one-tap "add missing to shopping".
- Files: `src/components/shared/ingredients-to-check.tsx` (consumes the resolved
  ingredient lines + `usePantry()` + `useShoppingList()` — all exist), wire into
  the Info sheet.
- Verify: live — toggle a pantry item, the check state updates; "add missing"
  threads quantity+recipe (the W-shopping thread already supports this).

**W8 — Side-pairing detail sheet (parity) [AB]**

- Goal: make the side-pairing result card's tap open the **same Info sheet**
  (health + ring + ingredients-to-check) so the user decides at the pairing step.
- Files: `src/components/today/result-stack.tsx` (the expand panel → mount the
  shared Info content for `side.id`), reuse `NutritionRingCard` +
  `IngredientsToCheck`.
- Verify: live — expand a side, see ring + ingredients-to-check; "Cook just this"
  remains the action.

**W9 — DRI target tables (age × sex) [AB]**

- Goal: replace the single FDA-DV target with proper RDA/AI by life-stage + sex.
- Files: `src/data/nutrition/dri.generated.json` (transcribe NAS 2020 from
  `cfree14/nutriR`'s bundled tables, cross-check NIH ODS), `src/lib/nutrition/
targets.ts` (`targetFor(nutrient, lifeStage, sex)`), `amdr.json`, `eaa.json`.
- Verify: unit tests vs known values (adult female calcium 1000 mg, etc.).

**W10 — Target engine wired into the ring [AB]**

- Goal: the ring's "Daily targets" use the DRI table + a chosen profile (default
  "adult, unspecified" → FDA DV; pediatric when Parent Mode age band set).
- Files: `nutrition-ring-card.tsx` (accept an optional `targets` prop),
  `targets.ts` resolver; Parent Mode already has the age band.
- Verify: switching age band changes the target denominators live.

**W11 — Coverage curation sprint (250 → ~400 ingredients) [AB]**

- Goal: import the next tranche of FDC foods for the unresolved ingredient names
  logged by the coverage report; push dish coverage ~85% → ~92%.
- Files: registry regeneration; a `scripts/ingredients/unresolved-report.mjs` that
  ranks unresolved names by dish frequency so curation targets the highest-impact
  gaps first.

**W12 — Nutrition tests + drift guards for the new vector [AB]**

- Extend `nutrition-system.test.ts`, `resolve-dish-lines.test.ts`,
  `guided-cook-summary.test.ts` to cover the 40-nutrient panel + amino acids; add a
  guard that every displayed dish has ≥ N resolved nutrients.

**W13 — Q1 review + recursive polish [AB]**

- Eyes-on every nutrition surface (cook flow, Info sheet, side detail); fix drift;
  ensure rule-13 minimalism holds; commit a Q1 coverage report doc.

### Q2 (W14–26) — Depth: amino acids, daily diary, personalization prep

**W14 — Amino-acid panel + protein-quality (DIAAS-lite) [AB]**
Surface the 9 EAAs (reference screenshot's Protein section) with the WHO/FAO
scoring pattern → a "complete protein?" signal. Files: `eaa.json`,
`src/lib/nutrition/protein-quality.ts`, ring's Amino acids group.

**W15 — Daily diary data model [AB]**
"Add to diary" (the reference's CTA) → a localStorage/Supabase day log of cooked
servings. Files: `src/lib/hooks/use-nutrition-diary.ts`, `src/types/diary.ts`
(date → entries[{recipeSlug, servings, at}]). Mirrors `useShoppingList` pattern.

**W16 — Daily totals + the day dashboard [AB]**
Aggregate diary entries → ΣNutrient for the day; a Path-tab "Today's nutrition"
card: the same ring, but for the _day_ vs the day's targets. Files:
`src/components/path/daily-nutrition-card.tsx`, `aggregateDay()` in the engine.

**W17 — Deficit/surplus insight line [AB]**
One ambient line ("low on iron today — a spinach side fixes it") computed from the
day's gaps × the side engine. Reuses `dish-therapeutic-profile`. Educational badge.

**W18 — Personalized target engine (FDA-DV → DRI → EER) [AB except G1]**
Build the `eer.json` schema + `energyTarget(profile)`; ship with the AMDR macro
split off FDA DV. **G1**: flip to 2023 NASEM EER when coefficients transcribed.

**W19 — Profile capture (playful, rule-3 compliant) [AB]**
Capture age band / activity through coach interactions (not a settings form);
store in the existing care-profile shape. Feeds targets.

**W20 — Branded-food engine (no UI yet) [AB]**
DuckDB-extract an OFF Parquet subset (top branded items) → `src/data/nutrition/
branded.generated.json` (isolated namespace, ODbL attribution). Build
`lookupBranded(name|barcode)`. No scanner yet.

**W21 — Branded search UI [AB]**
A "log a packaged food" search (the Whopper case) using the branded table; adds to
the diary. Files: `src/components/.../branded-search.tsx`.

**W22 — Barcode scan [FG: G2]**
_Prep (AB):_ the branded lookup-by-barcode path + a manual barcode-entry fallback.
_Gated:_ the camera-scan front-end + lib choice + (optional) OFF live API key.

**W23 — Water + hydration tracking [AB]**
Add `water_ml` to vectors (FDC has it) + a day water target; small diary affordance.

**W24 — Nutrient-density score (ANDI-lite) [AB]**
A per-dish density score (nutrients per calorie) for ranking/badging; feeds the
side engine as a soft signal.

**W25 — Trends (week view) [AB]**
A 7-day rollup of the diary: which nutrients consistently under/over target.

**W26 — Q2 review + recursive polish [AB]**

### Q3 (W27–39) — Intelligence: the engine gets smart

**W27 — Bioavailability modifiers [AB]** (iron + vitamin-C synergy, oxalate/phytate
inhibition — Sous already tracks oxalate/phytate per the reference). Soft factors,
flagged.
**W28 — Glycemic estimate [AB]** (GI/GL heuristic from carb composition + fiber).
**W29–W30 — Deficiency-aware side reranking [AB]** — the day's gaps reweight
`suggestSides()` (the W1 reblend pattern). The flagship moat feature: "you're low
on omega-3 → these sides fix it."
**W31 — Therapeutic × nutrient unification [AB]** — merge the existing
condition/intervention engine with the nutrient targets into one Info takeaway.
**W32 — Meal-plan nutrition rollup [AB]** — the weekly planner shows the week's
nutrient balance; gaps suggest swaps.
**W33 — Grocery nutrition preview [AB]** — the grocery list shows the nutrition the
planned recipes will deliver.
**W34 — Allergen/diet hard-filter integration [AB]** — care-profile `avoid` flags
cross the ingredient registry.
**W35 — Confidence/provenance surfacing [AB]** — a clear "estimated vs measured"
indicator per nutrient (data already carries it).
**W36 — Restaurant/branded diary parity [AB]**.
**W37 — Performance pass [AB]** — route-split the registry; ensure Today bundle
never pulls the full nutrient data; measure.
**W38 — Accessibility + reduced-motion audit of all nutrition surfaces [AB]**.
**W39 — Q3 review [AB]**.

### Q4 (W40–52) — Platform: polish, scale, real content

**W40–W41 — Coverage to ~95% [AB]** (final FDC tranche + curation).
**W42 — Clinician review surface for nutrient takeaways [FG: G3/G4]** _Prep:_ the
review queue + educational gating already exist; gated on a real reviewer.
**W43 — Personalized DRI go-live [FG: G1]** (EER coefficients in).
**W44 — Branded data refresh pipeline [AB]** (scheduled OFF re-extract).
**W45 — Export / share nutrition (image card) [AB]**.
**W46 — Nutrient education content in the Content tab [AB]** (Featured slot can
spotlight a nutrient/ingredient — the "ingredient advertisement" variant the user
asked for).
**W47 — Onboarding: nutrition goals (playful) [AB]**.
**W48 — A11y + i18n number/unit formatting [AB]**.
**W49 — Full regression + drift-guard sweep [AB]**.
**W50 — Scale test: 1000 dishes, 500 ingredients [AB]** — generate synthetic load,
confirm build-time composition + bundle budgets hold.
**W51 — Documentation + runbook [AB]** (how to add an ingredient, regenerate,
verify).
**W52 — Year review + next-year thesis [AB]**.

## Part 4 — What shipped already (down-payment on this plan)

- **W5 (early)** — `NutritionRingCard` (macro ring + targets + key micros +
  expandable) — shipped `e1aa9c1`, live on the Grab screen.
- **Content Featured** — the hero slot that W46's nutrient-spotlight reuses —
  shipped `3ab2280`.
- The **ingredients-to-check** primitive is one component away (W7) because the
  pantry + resolved-ingredient + shopping-thread data all already exist.

## Part 5 — Immediate next actions (the first PRs an agent can pick up)

1. `scripts/nutrition/import-fdc.mjs` (W1) — the CC0 import; everything downstream
   depends on it.
2. Widen `NutrientVector` (W2) — additive, back-compat, unlocks the panel.
3. Info rename + restructure (W6) + ingredients-to-check (W7) — the highest
   user-visible friction win, and zero new data.
